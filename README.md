# todo-list

### [Demo](https://kengyn.github.io/todo-list/)

#### Description
Todo list. Can create different projects and add, remove, edit tasks for them.

#### learnings
Built this to practice SOLID principles. Mainly the Single Responsiblity Principle. Reason is because having a function/class/module/object/etc do too many things can lead to it breaking if you change something in it. Having it have a single responsibility can help ease the pain when fixing or refactoring.

#### Built with
* HTML
* CSS
